## Requirements

- PHP 5.6+
- Hummingbird Lite 3.0.1+ <[vecode.net/hummingbird](https://io.vecode.net/hummingbird/)>
- NORM <[github.com/TheWebChimp/norm](https://github.com/TheWebChimp/norm)>

## Installation

First make sure you have all the required dependencies. If you don't meet a certain one, you'll be warned and the setup wizard will not let you continue until you add all the required files.

For NORM you will need to add the Model class, from this gist: https://gist.github.com/biohzrdmx/db1f81c3f077cf0cfb2a28b9c10ae760.

Include the required files on your `functions.inc.php file`, specifically:

	include $site->baseDir('/external/model.inc.php');
	include $site->baseDir('/external/norm.inc.php');
	include $site->baseDir('/external/crood.inc.php');

	include $site->baseDir('/external/lib/Parsedown.php');
	include $site->baseDir('/external/lib/PasswordHash.php');
	include $site->baseDir('/external/lib/SimpleImage.php');

And finally, include the CMS Platform file:

	include $site->baseDir('/external/cms/cms.inc.php');

Don't forget to create your database and configure it in your Hummingbird instance, [click here](https://docs.vecode.net/hummingbird-v3/tutorials/database) for more details on that.

Then, point your browser to your site url and you should be greeted by the Setup Wizard. Follow all the steps and you instance will be ready to rock.
